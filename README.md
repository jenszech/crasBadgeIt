# crasBadgeIt
ePaper interface for Conference Room Assistent System (CRAS)

Note that because this example puts the ESP into a deep sleep if you want to reprogram it via the USB then you have to manually stop and restart it using the slider switch at the moment just prior to the upload starting.

The project is based on different modules
* **[cras](https://github.com/jenszech/cras)** - needed backend project
* **[kras](https://github.com/julienP88/kras)** - optional responsive Angular frontend 
* Optional **[crasBadgeIt](https://github.com/jenszech/crasBadgeIt)** - this microcontroller project for small ePaper devices
* Optional **[crasAndroidViewer](https://github.com/jenszech/crasAndroidViewer)** - a simple android webviewer
